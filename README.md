# MWS-Project-Stage2
# Project Instructions
The stage 2 of the project builds the stage 1 further. We follow the below steps to develop this project.
1. Fork and clone the server repository (https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-2). Youâ€™ll use this development server to develop your project code.
2. Change the data source for your restaurant requests to pull JSON from the server, parse the response and use the response to generate the site UI.
3. Cache the JSON responses for offline use by using the IndexedDB API.
4. Follow the recommendations provided by Lighthouse to achieve the required performance targets.
# What do I do from here?
1. Refer https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-2 to setup and run Node development server.
2. Clone/Download this repository and establish a http server. It can be done either by a chrome extension or python. I used this chrome extension https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en to enable my http server.
Once your server is up and running, navigate to http://localhost:1337
